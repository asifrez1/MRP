Major Research Project for MSc in Data Science &amp; Analytics

For this project I have used the daily weather data of Toronto City to assess whether there is a change in the pattern of occurrence of rainfall and snowfall over the years in this region using Bayesian analysis procedure. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods were used to find the posterior. No-U-Turn Sampler, as a recent MCMC method, generated approximate posterior distributions of lengths of wet and dry spells for the rainfall and snowfall data for the 177-year period (1840 - 2017). By time series plotting of the posterior a comparison was made and it was found that the probabilities of wet spells have seen some significant changes over the time for both Rainfall and Snowfall Data; the trend is upward in the case of rainfalls while downward for snowfalls.
